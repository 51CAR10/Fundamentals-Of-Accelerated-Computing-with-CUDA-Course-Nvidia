## About this Course
This course explores how to use Numba‚Äîthe just-in-time, type-specializing Python function compiler‚Äîto accelerate Python programs to run on massively parallel NVIDIA GPUs. You‚Äôll learn how to:
* Use Numba to compile CUDA kernels from NumPy universal functions (ufuncs).
* Use Numba to create and launch custom CUDA kernels.
* Apply key GPU memory management techniques.

Upon completion, you‚Äôll be able to use Numba to compile and launch CUDA kernels to accelerate your Python applications on NVIDIA GPUs.


## Prerequisities
* Basic Python competency, including familiarity with variable types, loops, conditional statements, functions, and array manipulations.
* NumPy competency, including the use of ndarrays and ufuncs.
* No previous knowledge of CUDA programming is required.

## Suggested Resources to Satisfy Prerequisites
* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* [Numpy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

## Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks Used
* Numba
